    <p>My name is Said, I'm a web and application developer based in Austin. I'm passionate about technology and the impact it has on the world. I enjoy working with others to create web applications that solve problems and improve lives. I'm enthusiastic about front-end, back-end and test driven development and functional applications. I am a Mac, *nic user. I focus on two languages: Ruby and Javascript. Ruby on Rails is my preferred framework for the development of custom rich-internet applications. Rails is ideal for new application development with fast, iterative development loops. Quickly integrate existing open-source projects and APIs to speed up development times.</p>
